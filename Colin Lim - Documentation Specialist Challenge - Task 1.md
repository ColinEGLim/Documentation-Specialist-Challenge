Chainstack is a managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that you can use to rapidly set up and maintain a your own multi-protocol network across multiple cloud platforms. It is  scalable and resource-freeing toolset that can be grown with your business. 

With Chainstack, you can:

- Use multiple blockchain protocols. Chainstack doesn’t tie you down to one blockchain protocol, but instead offers multiple protocols such as Fabric, Quorum, Ethereum, Corda, and others. More protocols may be added once they emerge. 
- Each blockchain protocol uses different way to record immutable (permanent) transactions in a kind of electronic ledger that is open to view, but uses a consensus mechanism (massive security to ensure all parties or nodes on the chain agree to the transaction) to validate transactions.
- Deploy your own unique solution in Logistics, Supply Chain, Insurance, Finance, or even voting platforms and accounting systems.
- Blockchains aren’t only used for cryptocurrency. Use private blockchain protocols to have strong cryptography (security) as well as open auditability. This can typically be applied in an intra-business supply chain, for example.
- Use different cloud platforms such as Google Cloud, Azure, and Amazon Web Services.
- With cloud platforms, you don’t have to worry about expensive and complicated IT infrastructure and data centers.
- Connect to your existing legacy ERP and CRM applications.
- Use the provided toolset in the Chainstack platform to reduce or even eliminate excess costs in setting up your blockchain and platform infrastructure.
- Rapidly build, deploy and manage decentralized networks and applications.
- Quickly build consortiums by adding or maintaining members.
