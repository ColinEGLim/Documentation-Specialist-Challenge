# Getting Started: Launching a Blockchain Node

A blockchain node can be any electronic device with an IP address, such as your computer. Your node maintains a copy of the blockchain and is authorized to validate transactions to the immutable blockchain ledger.

With Chainstack, you can group related blockchain networks into a project.

This following section details how you can launch a blockchain node.
